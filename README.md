    ## Description

    This project focuses on using deep learning to detect different types of masks in images. It includes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a labeled dataset to classify images into four categories: Cloth mask, FFP2 Mask, No Mask, and Surgery Mask. The project is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes.
